This is the Final Lab where we are working on **Ingesting Logs** into our **Log Analytics Workspace**.

1. In this Lab we're going to finish things up by **Enabling Logging** for our **Storage Account** and forwarding it to the LAW.

2. We're going to Create a **Key Vault** ‚ûú and we'll **Enable Logging** for this and send the Logs to our LAW.

3. And as usual we're going to **Query** things and get a sense for what different Queries may look like.

<br>

> The first thing we're going to do is **Configure Logging** for our **Storage Account** that already exists in our Environment.

> We made a Storage Acount for our NSG flow Logs earlier, but the Logs are not enabled for it yet.
> 
> We'll do this by **Enabling Diagnostic Settings for Blob Storage**.

<br>

Inside the **Azure Portal** ‚ûú search for our **Storage Account** ```sacyberlab999```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb28fc29-6358-4720-8ab7-b0134b8c653d)

Then We'll scroll down and click on the **Diagnostic settings** blade:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2e5c3d6c-7fb5-4061-87eb-cfe7b2ca1bc0)

And we're going to Configure a Diagnostic Setting for the Blob Storage.

Click on **blob**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/82aa469c-4f87-4d73-927a-8717a5b74985)

And then we'll ‚ûï **Add diagnostic setting**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/12375231-1a9e-44aa-b4ee-cc7f1d9751ee)

- We can set up the **"Diagnostic setting name"** as ```ds-storage-account```

- For the **Logs‚Äô Category Groups** ‚ûú select ‚òëÔ∏è **audit**

- **"Destination details"** ‚ûú check ‚òëÔ∏è **Send to Log analytics workspace** ‚ûú select ```LAW-Cyber-Lab-01```
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è Again ‚ûú Make sure it‚Äôs going to the correct one ‚ûú not the *DefaultWorkspace*

- Click üíæ Save

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7eb8f87-c213-4a39-a71d-0ab06bbc7381)

The next thing we're going to do is Create an Azure Key Vault and Set Up Diagnostic Settings for it as well to send Logs into our LAW.

> Then we're going to **Add a Secret** to the Key Vault with a made up Password

> And finally we'll observe the Key in Key Vault

<br>

Back to the **Azure Portal** ‚ûú search for **Key Vault** ‚ûú and click on the **Create key vault** button

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0145ab6-e373-4a20-be1f-b813a645ace2)

- Select our **Resource group** ```RG-Cyber-Lab```

- For the **Key vault name** ‚ûú ‚ö†Ô∏è it has to be globally unique ‚ûú for example: ```akv-cyber-lab-9999```

- Put it in the same **Region** as everything else ‚ûú ```East US 2```

Click **Next**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e5d7174-3256-4c49-8908-02c86878c0e2)

Under the **"Access configuration"** tab:

- For **Permission model** ‚ûú change it to ‚óâ **Vault access policy**

Click **Review + create**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f097a391-fd88-4b75-b2e5-a8fdc7201444)

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

The next thing we're going to do is Create an Enterprise Secret

Open our **Key Vault** ```akv-cyber-lab-9999```

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8ea1c952-da65-4e57-a305-df1df588fd92)

Click on the **Secrets** blade ‚ûú and then ‚ûï **Generate/Import** to Create a New Secret:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d42e94e1-6ea0-4cbf-8bee-fb93be1f8529)

- You can **Name** the Secret ```Tenant-Global-Admin-Password``` for example:
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è This isn't the actual Password itself ‚ûú this is just the **Name** of the Password

- The actual Password is the **Secret value** ‚ûú for the sake of the lab we'll make it ```Cyberlab123!```

Then just click **Create**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4544b371-32aa-4614-9e48-33696fefdba6)

‚úÖ We can confirm that the Secret was Successfully Created:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a8863ec-e412-4169-82a1-f932f9fd5f2d)

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

We're now going to Enable **Diagnostic Settings** for **Key vault**

Inside our **Key Vault** ‚ûú click on the **Diagnostic settings** blade ‚ûú and then ‚ûï **Add diagnostic setting**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/680148fa-d114-41c9-82cc-96efec60bfc0)

- We can name it ```ds-akv```

- For the **Logs‚Äô Category Groups** ‚ûú select ‚òëÔ∏è **audit**

- **"Destination details"** ‚ûú check ‚òëÔ∏è **Send to Log analytics workspace** ‚ûú select ```LAW-Cyber-Lab-01```

- Click üíæ Save

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d8ba2c5-a3ed-4ac8-8ec5-6ff716c0ba97)

So now the Key Vault Logs should be forwarding to our Log Analytics Workspace.

<summary> <h2> 3Ô∏è‚É£ Generate some Logs for Storage Account & Key Vault</h2> </summary>
<br>

> The next step is to **Generate some Logs** for the **Blob Storage**.
>
> We'll **Upload a Text File** to the Blob Storage Account ‚ûú and that should **Create Log**s that we can actually **Query and Observe**.
> 

<br>

We'll go back to the **Azure Portal** ‚ûú open our **Storage Account**:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/91c92fdf-0306-40ff-8feb-136306bda1c7)

Click on the **Containers** blade ‚ûú and ‚ûï **Container** to create a new Container

- Name it ```test``` ‚ûú and click **Create**

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d245af47-b331-4d21-a3f0-59b837a86f8d)

<br>

>   <details close> 
>   
> **<summary> üí°</summary>**
> 
> For all intents and purposes here: you can think of Containers as a top-level folder inside of your Storage Account.
> 
>   </details>

So we created a Container called ```test```:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8113a37e-9a23-4664-8b23-d0ebdb6c1a7e)

And inside of our new Container ‚ûú we'll ‚Üë **Upload** a random Text File from our Computer:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ccf4aa6-ff38-4ab9-8605-86df702acaef)

‚úÖ The act of **Uploading a Blob File** into our **Storage Account** is going to **Create Data Plane Logs** that our **Diagnosting Setting** (which we created earlier) should send to our LAW.

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

> We're now going to **Generate some Logs** for the **Key Vault**.
>
> To do so we will **Observe the Secret** inside of the Key Vault.
> 

<br>

We'll **Create another Secret**:

- **Name** the Secret ```Super-Secret-Password-1``` for example:

- For the **Secret value** ‚ûú we can make it ```Cyberlab123!``` again

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/580b7c15-991b-4fcb-bb33-7b1288a711f5)

Now we have 2 Password in our Key Vault:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8b190daa-fec6-475f-ab04-7de2aeb094a9)

<br>

<h2></h2>

<br>

We can now click on the ```Super-Secret-Password-1``` Secret to observe it:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb3636db-2bcf-40c6-b925-b63818604ea4)

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/049e7797-081c-4dd1-a329-dd559d6c73fb)

Then we'll click on the **"Show Secret Value"** Button:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/faf2cc5d-cd14-4068-bb56-5c1970ce9bf9)

And the Secret Value / Password is revealed:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ee3f6c2f-a97a-44a0-9bd7-301ae43d5ffd)

‚úÖ The act of going to this page and **Show the Secret** should have **Created a Log** which will be forwarded to our LAW.

<summary> <h2> 4Ô∏è‚É£ Observe the Logs with KQL Queries</h2> </summary>
<br>

> At this point we should be able to Query the ```StorageBlobLogs``` from the **Azure Storage Account**.
> 
> And we should also be able to Query the ```AzureDiagnostics``` for the **Azure Key Vault**.

<br>

We can start out by going to our LAW and **Run the ```StorageBlobLogs``` Query** to Analyse the Blob Storage Logs:

![azure portal](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c4af6a8d-0f98-4916-9aef-d45901246705)

<br>

üìù **Exercise**:
 
> We can also Run some of the following **KQL Queries** to Analyze some of the Logs Generated.

As we now **Run the ```AzureDiagnostics``` Query** ‚ûú we can see that **Key Vault Logs** started coming into our LAW:
